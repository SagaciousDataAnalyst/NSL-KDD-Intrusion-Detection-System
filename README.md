<h1> NSL-KDD Intrusion Detection System</h1>
A network-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) is a dataset suggested to solve some of the inherent problems of the parent KDD'99 dataset. 
This IDS basically helps to determine security of systems and alarming when intrusion is noticed or detected.
Choosing NSL-KDD provides insightful analysis using various machine learning algorithms for intrusion detection. 
I expected to explore intuitive insights of intrusion detection and work on various machine learning algorithms,
that is reasonable to understand future instance of attacks and its types.

<h1>Project Responsibilities</h1>

Project Responsibilities:
1. Well researched NSL-KDD website to perform data extraction to fit the analytical requirements.
2. Worked on data cleaning and ensured data quality, consistency, integrity using Pandas, NumPy.
3. Dealt with missing values by removing unnecessary features and replacing missing data with statistical result.
4. Explored and visualized the data to get descriptive statistics and inferential statistics for better understanding the dataset. Data analysis performed with help of graphs using Tableau, Matplotlib and Seaborn library.
